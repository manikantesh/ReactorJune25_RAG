IN THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA

Case No. S987654

JANE SMITH, Plaintiff,
v.
CITY OF LOS ANGELES, Defendant.

Filed: June 10, 2015

OPINION BY JUSTICE LEE

This case concerns the enforceability of municipal contracts and the applicability of sovereign immunity. The plaintiff, Jane Smith, entered into a contract with the City of Los Angeles for consulting services. The City failed to pay for services rendered. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, awarding damages.

The Supreme Court of California held that municipal entities are not immune from suit for breach of contract where the contract was lawfully entered into and performed. The Court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.
